# LokkerRoom-Front-End

## What
This is the front-end for a chat application built with React. It provides the user interface for interacting with the back-end, allowing users to register, log in, and chat with each other in real-time.

## Why
This project aims to create a user-friendly front-end for a real-time chat application. It serves as the primary interface for users to interact with the back-end and perform various chat-related operations.

## When
The project was developed as part of a challenge to create a complete full-stack chat application. The front-end is built with React and is deployed, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## How
The front-end is built with the following technologies:
- **React** for the web framework
- **Axios** for HTTP requests to the back-end
- **React Router** for routing between different pages
- **Tailwind CSS** or **Bootstrap** for styling (optional)

To run the front-end locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm start`.
4. Ensure the back-end server is running and test the connection with the front-end.



## Roadmap
Here are some pending tasks and future improvements for the front-end:
- Fixing the connection with the back-end and deployment issues.
- Enhancing the user interface and user experience.
- Adding additional features like group chats, file sharing, etc.

- [Live Version]

**Note**: The live version of the front-end must contain a link back to the source code on GitHub.
